## Why?

I wanted a tool that allows you to:

+ Execute custom JavaScript code in a better way than Chrome debug console.
+ Automate daily web browsing in a better way than Puppeteer.
+ Extract data on the webpage programmtically.
+ Customize web page for yourself.

## Usage

The JavaScript code you write is automatically loaded on every web page.

1. Write JavaScript code in the Code pane.
2. Press the Run button.
3. The code will be executed whenever a web page is loaded.
